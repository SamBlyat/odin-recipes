    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>To make sushi, you need to cook some sushi rice with water, vinegar, sugar, and salt in a pot. Then you need to cut some raw fish (such as salmon or tuna) into thin slices. Next, you need to place a sheet of nori (seaweed) on a bamboo mat and spread some rice over it. Then you need to place some fish and other fillings (such as cucumber or avocado) on top of the rice. Next, you need to roll up the nori from one end to the other and press it firmly with the mat. Then you need to cut the roll into bite-sized pieces. Finally, you need to serve the sushi with soy sauce, wasabi (horseradish paste), and ginger</p>
