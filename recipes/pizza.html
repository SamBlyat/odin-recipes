    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>To make pizza, you need to make some pizza dough by mixing some flour, yeast, sugar, salt, water, and oil in a bowl. Then you need to knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic. Next, you need to let the dough rise in a warm place for about an hour until it doubles in size. Then you need to punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Next, you need to roll out each portion into a thin circle and place it on a baking sheet. Then you need to spread some pizza sauce over the dough and sprinkle some shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Next, you need to add some toppings of your choice (such as pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, etc.). Finally, you need to bake the pizza in the oven for about 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden.</p>
