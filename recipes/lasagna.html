    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>To make lasagna, you need to cook some ground meat (beef and pork) with onion, garlic, parsley, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and sugar in a skillet. Then you need to add some tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes to make a meaty sauce. Next, you need to boil some lasagna noodles until they are tender. Then you need to mix some cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl to make a cheese mixture. Finally, you need to layer the sauce, noodles, and cheese mixture in a baking dish and top it with shredded mozzarella cheese. Bake it in the oven for about 50 minutes until bubbly and golden.</p>
