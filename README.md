# Basic Recipe Website
This project is a simple website that displays some of my favorite recipes using only HTML. The goal of this project is to brush up on my HTML skills and practice creating a well-structured and semantic web page.

The website consists of a home page that introduces the project and links to three recipe pages. Each recipe page contains the title, image, ingredients and instructions of the dish. The website also has a footer that includes some information about me and a link to my GitHub profile.

## How to run the project locally
To run the project locally, you need to have Git installed on your computer. You can clone the project repository using the following command:
